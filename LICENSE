                            GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                           Version 3, 29 June 2007

Copyright (C) 2025  [Bakhtiyar Ahmad]
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

                        Preamble

The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software
and other kinds of works. The licenses for most software are designed
to take away your freedom to share and change it. By contrast, the GNU
General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share
and change free softwareâ€” to make sure the software is free for all
its users. This General Public License applies to most of the Free
Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose authors
commit to using it. (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have
the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for them
if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it if you want
it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new free
programs; and that you know you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
these rights or asking you to surrender the rights. Therefore, you
have certain responsibilities if you distribute copies of the software,
or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether
gratis or for a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
freedoms that you received. You must make sure that they, too, receive
or can get the source code. And you must show them these terms so
they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software,
and (2) offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to
copy, distribute, and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain
that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free
software. If the software is modified by someone else and passed on,
we want its recipients to know that what they have is not the
original, so that any problems introduced by others will not reflect
on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.
We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program
proprietary. To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent
licenses granted for a version of the program must be consistent with
the full freedom that the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee.

Therefore, by using this license, you ensure that everyone has the
freedom to use, modify, and distribute the software and its source
code.

                    TERMS AND CONDITIONS

0. Definitions.

    "This License" refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.

    "The Program" refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
    License. Each licensee is addressed as "you".

    "Copy" means either the verbatim copy or an adaptation of the
    Program.

    "Modifications" refers to any change made to the Program, including
    changes that are permanent or temporary.

    "Source Code" refers to the preferred form of the work for making
    modifications, and includes the script or other materials that are
    required to build, install, and modify the Program.

1. Source Code.

    You must provide or make available the source code for any version
    of the Program you distribute, and it must comply with the terms of
    this License.

2. Copyleft.

    The term "copyleft" refers to the requirement that you ensure that
    any modified version of the Program, when distributed, is licensed
    under the same terms as the original. This allows future users to
    enjoy the same freedoms.

3. License Grant.

    By using this License, you are granting everyone permission to use,
    copy, modify, and distribute the Program under the same terms as
    the original work, and they must do so with no additional restrictions.

4. No Warranty.

    The Program is provided "as-is", without any warranty of any kind.
    The author(s) are not responsible for any damages that result from
    the use of the software.

5. Acceptance.

    You may not use, copy, modify, or distribute the Program except
    in compliance with the terms of this License.
